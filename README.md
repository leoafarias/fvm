FVM streamlines Flutter version management. It allows per project SDK versions, ensuring consistent app builds and easier testing of new releases, thereby boosting the efficiency of your Flutter project tasks.

## Why FVM?

- Need for simultaneous use of multiple Flutter SDKs.
- SDK testing requires constant [channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels) switching.
- Channel switches are slow and need repeated reinstalls.
- Difficulty managing the latest successful SDK version used in an app.
- Flutter's major updates demand total app migration.
- Inconsistencies occur in development environments within teams.
