# Example

The following is a step by step if you want to run a specific version of Flutter within a project.

First choose the version you would like to install and cache on your machine.

This will install version 1.17.4 and cache locally.

```bash
> fvm install 1.17.4
```

Go into the project directory

```bash
> cd path/to/project
```

Set the project to use the version that you have installed.

```bash
> fvm use 1.17.4
```
