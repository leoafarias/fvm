# FVM 4.0.0 Release

We're excited to announce FVM 4.0.0, a major release that brings enterprise-grade features to Flutter version management. This release introduces fork repository support, modular workflow architecture, and enhanced integrations for teams managing complex Flutter environments.

## üéâ Highlights

### üîÄ Fork Repository Support
Manage Flutter SDKs from custom or forked repositories - perfect for enterprise teams with proprietary Flutter modifications.

```bash
# Add a fork
fvm fork add mycompany https://github.com/mycompany/flutter.git

# Install from fork
fvm install mycompany/stable
fvm install mycompany/3.19.0

# Use fork version in project
fvm use mycompany/stable
```

### üîó Melos Integration
First-class monorepo support with automatic `sdkPath` management in `melos.yaml`.

### üèóÔ∏è Modular Workflow Architecture
9 new workflows for better separation of concerns and maintainability.

## ‚ú® What's New

### Major Features
- **Fork repository management** - Complete system for managing custom Flutter distributions
- **`fvm fork` commands** - Add, remove, and list fork repositories
- **Fork version syntax** - Install using `<fork>/<version>` format
- **Melos integration** - Automatic monorepo configuration
- **Integration testing** - Hidden `fvm integration-test` command for comprehensive testing

### Architecture Improvements
- **Modular workflows** - 9 new workflows including:
  - `UpdateMelosSettingsWorkflow` - Melos integration
  - `SetupGitIgnoreWorkflow` - Smart .gitignore management
  - `UpdateVsCodeSettingsWorkflow` - VS Code configuration
  - `ValidateFlutterVersionWorkflow` - Enhanced validation
  - And 5 more for complete project lifecycle management
- **New services** - GitService, ProcessService, AppConfigService
- **File locking** - Prevents concurrent operations for better reliability
- **Git clone fallback** - Automatic recovery when reference clones fail

### Developer Experience
- **Better error messages** - Enhanced stack trace preservation and helpful error output
- **Fork-aware caching** - Organized cache structure: `~/.fvm/versions/<fork>/<version>`
- **Configuration option** - New `updateMelosSettings` flag for Melos control
- **Runtime deprecation warnings** - Clear warnings for unsupported environment variables
- **Legacy environment variable fallback** - `FVM_HOME` works as fallback when `FVM_CACHE_PATH` is not set
- **Enhanced environment variable processing** - Improved logic in AppConfigService for better reliability
- **Better environment variable precedence** - Clear fallback behavior and error messaging

## üíî Breaking Changes

- **Removed `fvm update`** - Use your package manager instead (`brew upgrade fvm`, `dart pub global activate fvm`)
- **Removed deprecated environment variable** - `FVM_GIT_CACHE` (deprecated since v3.0.0) is no longer supported
  - Use `FVM_FLUTTER_URL` instead of `FVM_GIT_CACHE`
  - **Note**: `FVM_HOME` is still supported as a fallback for `FVM_CACHE_PATH` but shows a deprecation warning

## üì¶ Installation

### macOS/Linux
```bash
# Homebrew (recommended)
brew tap leoafarias/fvm

## üöÄ Migration Guide

### From v3.x to v4.0

   ```

2. **Update environment variables** (if used):
   - Replace `FVM_GIT_CACHE` with `FVM_FLUTTER_URL` (required - `FVM_GIT_CACHE` no longer works)
   - Consider replacing `FVM_HOME` with `FVM_CACHE_PATH` (optional - `FVM_HOME` still works as fallback)

3. **For enterprise users** - Set up your forks:
   ```bash
   fvm fork add company https://github.com/company/flutter.git
   fvm use company/stable
   ```

## üìä By the Numbers

- **9** new workflows added
