FVM streamlines Flutter version management. It allows per project SDK versions, ensuring consistent app builds and easier testing of new releases, thereby boosting the efficiency of your Flutter project tasks.

## Why FVM?

- Need for simultaneous use of multiple Flutter SDKs.
- SDK testing requires constant [channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels) switching.
- Channel switches are slow and need repeated reinstalls.
- Difficulty managing the latest successful SDK version used in an app.
- Flutter's major updates demand total app migration.
- Inconsistencies occur in development environments within teams.

## Contributors

The Flutter community sits at the core of FVM. We're incredibly grateful to our open-source contributors whose dedication and hard work fuel this project.

Their invaluable participation helps us develop and manage Flutter versions more efficiently, making FVM a crucial tool for every Flutter developer. Without them, FVM wouldn't exist.

- Avoid overriding any Flutter CLI commands.
- Adhere to Flutter's recommended installation procedures for effective caching.
- Aim to enhance Flutter's behavior, not to alter it.
- Prioritize a simple and intuitive API.
