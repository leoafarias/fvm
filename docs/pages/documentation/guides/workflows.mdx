# Common Workflows

Quick guides for typical FVM tasks. Each workflow shows the essential commands to accomplish specific goals.

## Setting up a new project

Configure a Flutter project to use a specific SDK version.

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd myproject

# Set Flutter version
fvm use 3.19.0

# Or use latest stable
fvm use stable --pin
```

**Result:** Creates `.fvm` directory and `.fvmrc` configuration file.

## Switching between versions

Change SDK versions for different projects or testing.

```bash
# Check current version
fvm list

# Switch to different version
fvm use 3.16.0

# Force switch without validation
fvm use 3.16.0 --force
```

## Working with multiple flavors

Manage different SDK versions for development, staging, and production.

```bash
# Set development version
fvm use 3.19.0 --flavor development

# Set production version
fvm use 3.16.0 --flavor production

# Use flavor-specific version
fvm flavor development build apk
```

## Testing with different versions

Run tests across multiple Flutter SDK versions.

```bash
# Test with current project version
fvm flutter test

# Test with specific version
fvm spawn 3.19.0 test

# Test with another version
fvm spawn 3.16.0 test
```

## CI/CD integration

Set up FVM in continuous integration pipelines.

```bash
# Install FVM
dart pub global activate fvm

# Install project SDK version
fvm install

# Run Flutter commands
fvm flutter build apk --release
```

## Managing custom forks

Use company or personal Flutter forks.

```bash
# Add fork
fvm fork add company https://github.com/company/flutter.git

# Install from fork
fvm install company/stable

# Use fork version
fvm use company/3.19.0
```

## Global version setup

Configure a system-wide default Flutter version.

```bash
# Set global version
fvm global 3.19.0

# Add to PATH (one-time setup)
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.fvm/bin"

# Use global version
flutter doctor
```

## Cleaning up old versions

Remove unused SDK versions to free disk space.

```bash
# List installed versions
fvm list

# Remove specific version
fvm remove 3.10.0

# Remove all versions
fvm remove --all
```

## Monorepo setup

Configure FVM for projects with multiple Flutter apps.

```bash
# Root configuration
cd monorepo
fvm use 3.19.0

# App-specific versions
cd apps/mobile
fvm use 3.16.0

# Package uses root version
cd packages/shared
# Inherits from root
```

## Offline installation

Install Flutter SDK from local cache or network share.

```bash
# Configure custom cache path
fvm config --cache-path /shared/flutter-cache

# Disable git cache for offline use
fvm config --no-use-git-cache

# Install from local cache
fvm install 3.19.0
```

## Troubleshooting

Common solutions for FVM issues.

```bash
# Check environment
fvm doctor

# Verify project setup
cd myproject
fvm doctor

# Force reinstall
fvm remove 3.19.0
fvm install 3.19.0 --setup

# Reset global config
fvm global --unlink
```

## IDE configuration

### VS Code

FVM automatically configures VS Code settings. To manually configure:

1. Run `fvm use <version>` in project
2. Restart VS Code or reload window
3. Verify SDK path in settings

### Android Studio / IntelliJ

1. Open **Project Structure** (Cmd/Ctrl + ;)
2. Set **Flutter SDK path** to: `.fvm/flutter_sdk`
3. Apply and restart IDE

## Best practices

### Version selection

- Use specific versions for production apps
- Pin channels for active development
- Document version requirements in README

### Team collaboration

```bash
# Add to .gitignore
.fvm/flutter_sdk

# Commit these files
.fvmrc
.fvm/fvm_config.json
```

### Performance tips

- Enable git cache for faster installs
- Use `--skip-setup` when switching versions frequently
- Run `fvm install` in CI before build steps
