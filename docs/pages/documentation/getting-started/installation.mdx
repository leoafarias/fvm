# Installation

There are a few ways to install FVM, and we are working on other ways to make it even simpler.

## Recommendation

We recommend installing the Flutter SDK globally using the official installation guide [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). This will be the main version of Flutter across your machine.

Use FVM to manage the Flutter SDK version for your projects.

You can download the standalone packages from the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/releases).

### Install.sh

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fvm.app/install.sh | bash
```

### Homebrew

Install

```
brew tap leoafarias/fvm
brew install fvm
```

Uninstall

```
brew uninstall fvm
brew untap leoafarias/fvm
```

  </Tabs.Tab>

To install FVM (Install), run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell:

```bash
choco install fvm
```

  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
### Install.sh

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fvm.app/install.sh | bash
```

### Homebrew

Install

```
brew tap leoafarias/fvm
brew install fvm
```

Uninstall

```
brew uninstall fvm
brew untap leoafarias/fvm
```

</Tabs.Tab>

You are also able to install FVM as a [pub package](https://pub.dev/packages/fvm).

However, if you plan on using FVM to manage your [global Flutter install](/documentation/guides/global-configuration), we recommend installing it as a standalone.

<Callout type="warning">
  This is not recommended if you plan on using FVM to manage your global Flutter install.
</Callout>

```bash
dart pub global activate fvm
```

</Tabs.Tab>

## PATH Setup

After installation, add FVM to your PATH:

Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
```

  </Tabs.Tab>

Add to your PATH environment variable:

```
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin
```
