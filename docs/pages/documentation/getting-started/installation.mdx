# Installation

There are a few ways to install FVM, and we are working on other ways to make it even simpler.

## Recommendation

We recommend install Flutter SDK globally using the official installation guide [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). This will be the main version of Flutter across your machine.

Use FVM to manage the Flutter SDK version for your projects.

You can download the standalone packages from the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/releases).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fvm.app/install.sh | bash
```

### Homebrew

```
brew tap leoafarias/fvm
brew install fvm
```

You are able to also install FVM as a [pub package](https://pub.dev/packages/fvm).

However if you plan on using FVM to manage your [global Flutter install](/docs/guides/global_version) we recommend installing as a standalone.

<Callout type="warning">
  This is not recommended if you plan on using FVM to manage your global Flutter
  install.
</Callout>

```bash
dart pub global activate fvm
```
