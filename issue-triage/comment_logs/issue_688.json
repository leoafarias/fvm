But if like me you need to change the flutter engine. Then we need to be able to set FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL in order to get a new pre-compiled flutter engine. This gets complex when you need to compile flutter engines for multiple platform, therefore being able to access pre-compiled flutter sdks is an important need.\n","createdAt":"2025-09-02T18:01:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/issues/688#issuecomment-3246302705","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"number":688,"state":"OPEN","title":"Support a custom FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL as the source for Flutter package downloads","updatedAt":"2025-09-02T18:05:07Z","url":"https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/issues/688"}
