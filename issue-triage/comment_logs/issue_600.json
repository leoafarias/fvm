Before the current behavior, the IDE wrote a `PROJECT_DIR` path in it. With the current behavior, it resolves the symlink and writes ` USER_HOMEDIR` paths in it, which breaks the dynamic SDK switch.\r\nFVM _could_ update those paths, but this will likely get overwritten by the IDE anytime, so it will break again.  \r\n\r\nIt looks like `puro.dev` is doing it: https://github.com/pingbird/puro/blob/146a79d729aff35dc2282bb076047d1e166f1e21/puro/lib/src/workspace/intellij.dart#L75-L160 - so they will have the same issue as soon as the plugin is saving something different/new paths.
