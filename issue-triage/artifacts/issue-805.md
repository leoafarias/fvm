## Summary
User suggests integrating Dashmon to provide auto hot reload directly via FVM.

## Assessment
- FVM focuses on Flutter SDK version management. IDE/dev workflow enhancements (hot reload watchers) fall outside scope per project principles.

## Recommendation
Politely decline/close; document alternative (Dashmon, `flutter run --hot` watchers, etc.).

## Classification Recommendation
- Folder: `resolved/`
