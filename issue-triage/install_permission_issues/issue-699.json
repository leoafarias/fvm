Please install correctly, run `pub cache repair`. Close the terminal and try again.\r\n- [x] If you are on Windows. Make sure you are running the terminal as `administrator` or with `developer` permissions.\r\n- [x] Run `fvm doctor` if possible and add the output to the issue.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using the `install.sh` to install the FVM as a standalone bin the script will try to create a link target in the `/usr/local/bin/fvm` which requires sudo privileges.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to terminal..\r\n2. Run `curl -fsSL https://fvm.app/install.sh | bash`\r\n5. See an error \r\n\r\n> permission denied: /usr/local/bin/fvm\r\n> Failed to create symlink.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe FVM bin can be run from anywhere on the system after installation.\r\n\r\n**Logs**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: [linux ubuntu]\r\n- FVM Version [N/A]\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nwe have tow options to discuss:\r\n\r\n1. The docs should state that the user should run the script with sudo or in root user mode, then the FVM bin will be in `/usr/local/bin/fvm` without any errors\r\n2. Change the link target to `$HOME/.local/bin/fvm`\r\n\r\nI have modified the install.sh script to use `$HOME/.local/bin/fvm` and everything worked as expected.\r\n","closedAt":"2024-10-01T17:15:26Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOCkCuKM54IP8F","author":{"login":"leoafarias"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"@Nidal-Bakir can you do a PR so I can review?","createdAt":"2024-03-22T16:10:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/issues/699#issuecomment-2015428357","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOCkCuKM54JC6D","author":{"login":"Nidal-Bakir"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"sure thing...\r\n#700","createdAt":"2024-03-22T18:02:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/issues/699#issuecomment-2015637123","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOCkCuKM5__Kds","author":{"login":"jamilxt"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I am facing this issue for a long time.
