The error occurred despite using `sudo` with the `curl` command. It seems that the symbolic link creation step inside the bash script requires superuser permissions, but the script itself isn't being executed with the necessary privileges.\r\n\r\nSystem Information:\r\n\r\nOS: Pop!_OS (based on Ubuntu)\r\nArchitecture: x64\r\nFVM Version: 3.2.1 (detected by the installer)\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n1. Run the following command on a Linux system (Pop!_OS in this case):\r\n   ```bash\r\n   sudo curl -fsSL https://fvm.app/install.sh | bash\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkaround: Running the following command resolves the issue:\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -fsSL https://fvm.app/install.sh | sudo bash\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2024-12-31T04:01:47Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOCkCuKM6TNVN2","author":{"login":"zakblacki"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Same issue \r\n","createdAt":"2024-11-12T06:59:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/issues/796#issuecomment-2469745526","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOCkCuKM6VWP_Q","author":{"login":"steffenkleinle"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"We experience the same issue when attempting to install fvm in the CI.
