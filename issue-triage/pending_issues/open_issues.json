Permissions & sudo/doas friction\n\nRight now a “normal user install” requires:\n\nWrite access to ~/.fvm_flutter ✅\n\nPlus sudo/doas to touch /usr/local/bin ❌\n\nSo a non-privileged, per-user install still fails if:\n\nNo sudo/doas, or\n\n/usr/local/bin is managed by something else (Nix, system packaging, etc.), or\n\nYou just don’t want the script messing with system dirs.\n\nA per-user install ideally never needs privilege escalation.\n\n3. Uninstall semantics are confusing\n\nUninstall runs as the current user and:\n\nDeletes $HOME/.fvm_flutter\n\nRemoves /usr/local/bin/fvm (using sudo/doas)\n\nBut:\n\nIf multiple users are on the system and one uninstalls, they blow away a symlink that may have been created during a “system-ish” install.\n\nIf some admin later installs a global fvm to /usr/local/bin, your uninstall logic might remove it if the symlink target happens to match your heuristic.\n\n4. Home directory dependence for a “system” binary\n\nEven when you’re the only user:\n\n/usr/local/bin/fvm depends on $HOME being the same directory used at install time.\n\nIf you move home, change username, or restore from backup with a different path → fvm is broken.\n\nSystem binaries should not depend on the installer user’s $HOME.",

This will not work...\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Create a RISC-V VM (documentation is available, e.g. [here for Ubuntu](https://canonical-ubuntu-boards.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/how-to/qemu-riscv/))\n2. Install unzip `apt update && apt install -y unzip` (cf. #968)\n3. Download fvm latest release and extract:\n```\ncurl -L -O https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/releases/download/4.0.1/fvm-4.0.1-linux-riscv64.tar.gz\ntar xzf fvm-4.0.1-linux-riscv64.tar.gz\ncd fvm\n```\n3.

But then we still miss the Flutter engine.\n\nAnother way is to use the patches mentioned in the articles linked in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/99963. However I'm not sure if you want to do that, and there is still no flutter engine available in binary form.\n\nAnother way would be to use a flutter engine from another place than google, that would be maintained by the community or another organization. I plan to investigate building a flutter engine for riscv64, trying to automate that build, and we will see how that goes. I will communicate more when concrete plans are in place.\n\nI'm not sure what you think as a maintainer of fvm, whether that seems like a total waste of your time for 0.1% of users or if you are willing to introduce special cases and dedicate a bit of time for that. But I think that if you want to support RISC-V, it might be more complex than initially thought.",

This is a significant disk space issue, considering for example that our current version of flutter consumers 2.4G in the cache.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nSharing the cache is not possible, even if users are not accessing it concurrently, because fvm assigns file ownership to the current user (at the time of file creation in the cache), and permissions are set to 644 on the files. While user A may be able to read a file from the cache that was written during activity from user B, it won't be possible for fvm to write those files during activity from user A. Since we don't know if fvm may ever attempt to write a file already present in the cache, we as users must defensively assume that the fvm cache cannot be shared.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nEach user can configure their own fvm cache (using `fvm config --cache-path`), but this duplicates downloads and substantially defeats the purpose of having a cache. Attempts have not been successful to either (a) have fvm run under its own user account, or (b) have fvm create cache files with permission 664.\n\n**Additional context**\nWe also use fvm on Windows, but have not yet investigated potential cache sharing on that platform.",

Please describe.**\r\nFor Nix and NixOS users, a nix package is necessary for installation\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFollowing [nixpkgs conventions](https://github.com/AdrienLemaire/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), we should create a file `package.nix`.\r\nHere's a template to get started with:\r\n\r\n```nix\r\n{ lib\r\n, stdenv\r\n, fetchFromGitHub\r\n}:\r\n\r\nstdenv.mkDerivation rec {\r\n  pname = \"fvm\";\r\n  version = \"3.2.1\";\r\n\r\n  src = fetchFromGitHub {\r\n    owner  = \"leoafarias\";\r\n    repo   = \"fvm\";\r\n    rev    = \"v${version}\";\r\n    sha256 = \"06ywxznch1r9fb6598i632rz207vw3ncg9g1yabarrnj3920kfwb\";\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  phases = [ \"installPhase\" ];\r\n  installPhase = ''\r\n    mkdir -p $out/bin\r\n    # If we fetched a single binary named fvm:\r\n    cp fvm-${version} $out/bin/fvm\r\n    chmod +x $out/bin/fvm\r\n  '';\r\n\r\n  meta = with lib; {\r\n    description = \"Flutter Version Management: CLI to manage multiple Flutter SDK versions\";\r\n    homepage    = \"https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm\";\r\n    license     = licenses.mit;\r\n    maintainers = [ maintainers.yourName ];\r\n    platforms   = platforms.all;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI was considering creating the nix package myself, but being a new nixos user, I lack experience with it. Since fvm has a lot of pre-built packages for different platforms, I'm not sure what would be the best way to support them all in nix.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSimilar packages such as [volta](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/0c927e167da69400ad62da2c828ba465339e5144/pkgs/by-name/vo/volta/package.nix) have their nix package and could be used as reference.\r\n",

But that seems to be an issue with fvm as @aguilaair mentioned in the mentioned issue above.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n- Can't offer reliable reproduction steps, but it happened when I was in stable version 3.7.0 and wanted to upgrade to a higher version.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nEither fvm is throwing an error message or fails, or the underlying issue is getting solved.\r\n\r\n**Logs**\r\nPlease provide the verbose logs by running `--verbose` after the command.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS Sequoia 15.2\r\n- FVM Version: 3.2.1\r\n\r\n@leoafarias this is just a reminder and follow up issue, if you need this.

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI believe FVM is a perfect solution to have multiple versions of Flutter in the project.\r\nI.e. the git branch(es) for the ongoing development use the most recent Flutter version. At the same time we have maintenance branches, in which we provide bug-fixes for the already released versions.\r\nThe maintenance branches should keep their dependencies 'frozen' and always use Flutter version with which they were released. At least until we decide to upgrade Flutter to the latest bugfixing version, or so.\r\n\r\nThe git-managed _.fvmrc_ and _.vscode/settings.json_ are already getting into this direction. Whenever I checkout a maintenance branch, they are updated accordingly and use the version I need.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the gitignored .fvm folder is not updated and causes inconsistency. And error message _The SDK configured in dart.flutterSdkPath is not a valid SDK folder._ in VS Code.\r\nThen it gets somewhat tricky to bring it to consistency with `fvm use`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like the Flutter version to always match the one in _.fvmrc_. And auto-switch whenever it is updated.\r\n\r\nFor this, I beliieve the following is needed:\r\n* _.fvm_ folder should not contain anything except of the _versions_ subfolder\r\n* a Flutter version, one linked with `fvm use` command, should never be unlinked. In particular, it should not be unlinked when fvm-using another version. Then the version/path referred-to from _.vscode/settings.json_ would always work.\r\n\r\nI do not know what _.fvm/flutter_sdk_ link is for. If this is really necessary, and could not be removed, perhaps it could be linked to the version link in _versions_ subfolder. This would make it relative. Then it could be git-managed and updated accordingly on checkout.\r\nThe other files (release, version, fvm_config.json) seem excessive to me. I could add them to git though, if they cannot be removed.\r\n\r\nSo two critical changes to make the behavior happen are:\r\n* keep symlinks to all used versions, not only ot the current one\r\n* remove or make relative the symlink _.fvm/flutter_sdk_\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\nIn version 2 and in version 3 of fvm I've experienced issues where CLI tools and the VSCode debugger itself will act on the flutter code through the .fvm directory.\r\n\r\nFor instance: when debugging my Flutter project in VSCode with \"Debug My Code\" on and \"All Exceptions\" checked, it will still show me errors inside of the flutter code. Note: I DO NOT have \"Debug My Code + Packages + SDK\" turned on.\r\n\r\nI've also experienced issues with recursive features of CLI tools including the very_good_cli.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd love to have an option in the .fvmrc file to add a path (relative or absolute) for the .fvm directory so I can specify that it lives somewhere outside of my project.\r\n\r\n### .fvmrc with directory path\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"flutter\": \"3.19.3\",\r\n  \"fvmPath\": \"..\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the addition of this change I could move my project into another folder and have the .fvm directory live there. \r\n\r\n### Prior to Change\r\n```bash\r\n.\r\n├── my_project\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After the Change\r\n```bash\r\n.\r\n├── my_project_workspace\r\n│   ├── .fvm\r\n│   ├── my_project\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've considered reaching out to the maintainers of each tool I use and report the problem, but if I were able to move the location of the .fvm folder so it's outside of my project I wouldn't need to do this in the future.\r\n",

Now there are borders around everything. I understand some may like it, but I really don't – I wish there was a way to disable it, or that an earlier UI could be restore without impacting functionality.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>fvm list - before</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ fvm list\r\nCache Directory:  /Users/bartek/fvm/versions\r\n\r\nmaster\r\n3.19.0 (global)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n<details><summary>fvm list - after</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ fvm list\r\nCache directory:  /Users/bartek/fvm/versions\r\n\r\n┌─────────┬─────────┬────────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┬────────┐\r\n│ Version │ Channel │ Flutter Version    │ Dart Version    │ Release Date │ Global │\r\n├─────────┼─────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┼────────┤\r\n│ master  │         │ 3.20.0-13.0.pre.30 │ 3.4.0-175.0.dev │              │        │\r\n├─────────┼─────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┼────────┤\r\n│ 3.19.0  │ stable  │ 3.19.0             │ 3.3.0           │ Feb 15, 2024 │ ●      │\r\n└─────────┴─────────┴────────────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┴────────┘\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details> \r\n\r\nI prefer the first UI style much more - it's simpler, takes less space, and is easier to parse. I appreciate however more information provided by the second UI style.\r\n\r\nBut what's worse is that fvm v3 broke the unofficial Zsh shell completion script ([source](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/blob/master/src/_fvm)).\r\n\r\nIt used to work great, like this (example of `fvm install <TAB>`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/assets/40357511/130da616-0bb5-46b6-9afe-e90982d14ab2\r\n\r\nbut now it breaks, likely because of the addition of colored borders:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/assets/40357511/d093fbbf-93fa-4e12-b9f5-c81783f173e2\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nUse TAB shell completion on fvm v3. For example, try `$ fvm install <TAB>` and notice how it breaks.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n- I want to be able to go back to the old v2 UI. Additional option in `.fvmrc` would be great.\r\n- I expect shell completion to work as before.\r\n\r\n**Desktop**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS 14 Sonoma\r\n- FVM Version: 3.0.13\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI very much appreciate the awesome work you're doing with `fvm` - thank you. I am willing to help contribute this if you agree.\r\n",

Here's a revised version of the text, keeping the bullet points structure:\r\n\r\nFVM now performs various checks for Dart SDK project constraints and dependencies to provide more informative feedback to the user. However, we have some suggestions to make this process even better.\r\n\r\n- [ ]  It would be extremely helpful if FVM could install Flutter SDK based on a Dart SDK constraint. For example, running `fvm use 2.14 --dart` would install the latest version of Flutter that supports this version of Dart.\r\n- [ ] Also it would be great if FVM could easily run commands on the lowest and highest SDK constraint of pubspec. As a package creator, this is crucial for checking for deprecations or issues with the constraints.\r\n- [ ] When calling `fvm dart ...` if no version is configured in the project, and when falling back to PATH, it should fall back to Dart SDK configured in the Flutter SDK, and not the Dart SDK configured within the path\r\n\r\n### Discussed in https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/discussions/532\r\n",
