Please describe.**\nWhen multiple fvm users share a linux-based machine, it does not appear to be possible for the fvm cache to be shared among those users. This is a significant disk space issue, considering for example that our current version of flutter consumers 2.4G in the cache.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nSharing the cache is not possible, even if users are not accessing it concurrently, because fvm assigns file ownership to the current user (at the time of file creation in the cache), and permissions are set to 644 on the files. While user A may be able to read a file from the cache that was written during activity from user B, it won't be possible for fvm to write those files during activity from user A. Since we don't know if fvm may ever attempt to write a file already present in the cache, we as users must defensively assume that the fvm cache cannot be shared.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nEach user can configure their own fvm cache (using `fvm config --cache-path`), but this duplicates downloads and substantially defeats the purpose of having a cache. Attempts have not been successful to either (a) have fvm run under its own user account, or (b) have fvm create cache files with permission 664.\n\n**Additional context**\nWe also use fvm on Windows, but have not yet investigated potential cache sharing on that platform.",

This can lead to missing `.gitignore` entries, resulting in inconsistent setups across generated projects.\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd a `--[no-]update-gitignore` flag to explicitly control whether `.gitignore` should be updated, regardless of other flags.\n\n\n### Sample current output\n\n```bash\n$ fvm use 3.32.4 --force --skip-setup\n[WARN] Not checking for version mismatch as --force flag is set.\nYou should add the fvm version directory \".fvm/\" to .gitignore.\n[WARN] Skipping .gitignore confirmation because of --force flag detected\n✓ Project now uses Flutter SDK : SDK Version : 3.32.4\n┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ ✓ Running on VsCode, please restart the terminal to apply changes. │\n└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\nYou can then use \"flutter\" command within the VsCode terminal.\n```",

Please describe.**  \nManaging multiple Flutter versions manually can be a bit tedious. For example, when I want to remove all patch versions of a specific minor version like `3.27.x`, I have to list and remove them one by one.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**  \nI'd like to be able to use wildcards in the `fvm remove` command, such as: \n\n```\nfvm remove 3.27.*\n```\n\nThis would remove all installed versions that match `3.27.*` (e.g., `3.27.0`, `3.27.1`, etc.).\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**  \nCurrently, I use a shell script to list all versions and filter by pattern, then run `fvm remove` in a loop. But having this natively supported in `fvm` would be more intuitive and convenient.\n\n**Additional context**  \nThis feature would be especially useful when cleaning up older patch versions or managing disk space more efficiently.\n",

    "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI believe FVM is a perfect solution to have multiple versions of Flutter in the project.\r\nI.e. the git branch(es) for the ongoing development use the most recent Flutter version. At the same time we have maintenance branches, in which we provide bug-fixes for the already released versions.\r\nThe maintenance branches should keep their dependencies 'frozen' and always use Flutter version with which they were released. At least until we decide to upgrade Flutter to the latest bugfixing version, or so.\r\n\r\nThe git-managed _.fvmrc_ and _.vscode/settings.json_ are already getting into this direction. Whenever I checkout a maintenance branch, they are updated accordingly and use the version I need.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the gitignored .fvm folder is not updated and causes inconsistency. And error message _The SDK configured in dart.flutterSdkPath is not a valid SDK folder._ in VS Code.\r\nThen it gets somewhat tricky to bring it to consistency with `fvm use`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like the Flutter version to always match the one in _.fvmrc_. And auto-switch whenever it is updated.\r\n\r\nFor this, I beliieve the following is needed:\r\n* _.fvm_ folder should not contain anything except of the _versions_ subfolder\r\n* a Flutter version, one linked with `fvm use` command, should never be unlinked. In particular, it should not be unlinked when fvm-using another version. Then the version/path referred-to from _.vscode/settings.json_ would always work.\r\n\r\nI do not know what _.fvm/flutter_sdk_ link is for. If this is really necessary, and could not be removed, perhaps it could be linked to the version link in _versions_ subfolder. This would make it relative. Then it could be git-managed and updated accordingly on checkout.\r\nThe other files (release, version, fvm_config.json) seem excessive to me. I could add them to git though, if they cannot be removed.\r\n\r\nSo two critical changes to make the behavior happen are:\r\n* keep symlinks to all used versions, not only ot the current one\r\n* remove or make relative the symlink _.fvm/flutter_sdk_\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nYes, I use a few scripts which rely on using naked `flutter` calls instead of `fvm` since they operate on the CI as well. However, this creates an issue when working seamlessly with`fvm` on my local machine. I'm assuming a lot of folks would end up with such a situation.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI feel it might benefit a lot of people if we include a documentation that allowed people to redirect naked flutter/dart calls to fvm.  I understand this might create slight friction with fvm principles, however since its documentation and strictly optional, Im assuming it wouldn't be an issue. The documentation can be along the following lines\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n### Reroute flutter & dart commands (Optional)\r\nYou can run the commands below so that all calls invoking `flutter` or `dart` are automatically redirected to using `fvm flutter` or `fvm dart`.\r\n\r\n**On Mac**\r\n- `sudo echo 'fvm flutter ${@:1}' > \"/usr/local/bin/flutter\" && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/flutter`\r\n- `sudo echo 'fvm dart ${@:1}' > \"/usr/local/bin/dart\" && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dart`\r\n\r\n**On Linux**\r\n- `echo 'fvm flutter ${@:1}' > \"$HOME/.local/bin/flutter\" && chmod +x \"$HOME/.local/bin/flutter\"`\r\n- `echo 'fvm dart ${@:1}' > \"$HOME/.local/bin/dart\" && chmod +x \"$HOME/.local/bin/dart\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Remove reroutes\r\n\r\n**On Mac**\r\n- `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/flutter`\r\n- `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/dart`\r\n\r\n**On Linux**\r\n- `rm \"$HOME/.local/bin/dart\"`\r\n- `rm \"$HOME/.local/bin/flutter\"`\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI have considered command aliases as an alternate approach which are less intrusive however, they wont work with scripts unless you export the corresponding environment files from within the script.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm still figuring a way to do an equivalent in windows but I don't own a machine so it would be great if someone else can provide a snippet. There are caveats to this approach as well, mainly if a user already has installed flutter via brew or any other native package managers, the binaries may conflict. I'd assume adding a note around this would inform users about the same.",

Please describe.**\r\nIn version 2 and in version 3 of fvm I've experienced issues where CLI tools and the VSCode debugger itself will act on the flutter code through the .fvm directory.\r\n\r\nFor instance: when debugging my Flutter project in VSCode with \"Debug My Code\" on and \"All Exceptions\" checked, it will still show me errors inside of the flutter code. Note: I DO NOT have \"Debug My Code + Packages + SDK\" turned on.\r\n\r\nI've also experienced issues with recursive features of CLI tools including the very_good_cli.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd love to have an option in the .fvmrc file to add a path (relative or absolute) for the .fvm directory so I can specify that it lives somewhere outside of my project.\r\n\r\n### .fvmrc with directory path\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"flutter\": \"3.19.3\",\r\n  \"fvmPath\": \"..\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the addition of this change I could move my project into another folder and have the .fvm directory live there. \r\n\r\n### Prior to Change\r\n```bash\r\n.\r\n├── my_project\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After the Change\r\n```bash\r\n.\r\n├── my_project_workspace\r\n│   ├── .fvm\r\n│   ├── my_project\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've considered reaching out to the maintainers of each tool I use and report the problem, but if I were able to move the location of the .fvm folder so it's outside of my project I wouldn't need to do this in the future.\r\n",

I understand some may like it, but I really don't – I wish there was a way to disable it, or that an earlier UI could be restore without impacting functionality.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>fvm list - before</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ fvm list\r\nCache Directory:  /Users/bartek/fvm/versions\r\n\r\nmaster\r\n3.19.0 (global)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n<details><summary>fvm list - after</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ fvm list\r\nCache directory:  /Users/bartek/fvm/versions\r\n\r\n┌─────────┬─────────┬────────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┬────────┐\r\n│ Version │ Channel │ Flutter Version    │ Dart Version    │ Release Date │ Global │\r\n├─────────┼─────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┼────────┤\r\n│ master  │         │ 3.20.0-13.0.pre.30 │ 3.4.0-175.0.dev │              │        │\r\n├─────────┼─────────┼────────────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┼────────┤\r\n│ 3.19.0  │ stable  │ 3.19.0             │ 3.3.0           │ Feb 15, 2024 │ ●      │\r\n└─────────┴─────────┴────────────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┴────────┘\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details> \r\n\r\nI prefer the first UI style much more - it's simpler, takes less space, and is easier to parse. I appreciate however more information provided by the second UI style.\r\n\r\nBut what's worse is that fvm v3 broke the unofficial Zsh shell completion script ([source](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/blob/master/src/_fvm)).\r\n\r\nIt used to work great, like this (example of `fvm install <TAB>`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/assets/40357511/130da616-0bb5-46b6-9afe-e90982d14ab2\r\n\r\nbut now it breaks, likely because of the addition of colored borders:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/assets/40357511/d093fbbf-93fa-4e12-b9f5-c81783f173e2\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nUse TAB shell completion on fvm v3. For example, try `$ fvm install <TAB>` and notice how it breaks.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n- I want to be able to go back to the old v2 UI. Additional option in `.fvmrc` would be great.\r\n- I expect shell completion to work as before.\r\n\r\n**Desktop**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS 14 Sonoma\r\n- FVM Version: 3.0.13\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI very much appreciate the awesome work you're doing with `fvm` - thank you. I am willing to help contribute this if you agree.\r\n",

    "body": "Certainly! Here's a revised version of the text, keeping the bullet points structure:\r\n\r\nFVM now performs various checks for Dart SDK project constraints and dependencies to provide more informative feedback to the user. However, we have some suggestions to make this process even better.\r\n\r\n- [ ]  It would be extremely helpful if FVM could install Flutter SDK based on a Dart SDK constraint. For example, running `fvm use 2.14 --dart` would install the latest version of Flutter that supports this version of Dart.\r\n- [ ] Also it would be great if FVM could easily run commands on the lowest and highest SDK constraint of pubspec. As a package creator, this is crucial for checking for deprecations or issues with the constraints.\r\n- [ ] When calling `fvm dart ...` if no version is configured in the project, and when falling back to PATH, it should fall back to Dart SDK configured in the Flutter SDK, and not the Dart SDK configured within the path\r\n\r\n### Discussed in https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/discussions/532\r\n",

Since recently, I've had to use a Mac that has multiple user accounts. Due to limitations, Homebrew is not usable on a multi-user Mac environment. So I switched to [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) as the package manager for macOS.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCurrently fvm is distributed via Homebrew. It would be great if you could make it available on MacPorts as well.\r\n\r\nThank you.",

    "body": "**Problem description**\r\n\r\nI just installed fvm, intending to use it to switch quickly between the latest flutter 2 release and the latest flutter 3 release.\r\n\r\nAfter installation, I intuitively ran `fvm install 2` to download the latest Flutter 2 SDK with fvm and get started with my configuration.\r\n\r\nfvm printed:\r\n```\r\nFlutter \"2\" is not installed.\r\n\r\nInstalling version: 2...\r\nCloning into '/Users/thor/fvm/versions/2'...\r\nfatal: Remote branch 2 not found in upstream origin\r\n\r\nCould not install 2\r\n\r\nPlease run command with  --verbose if you want more information\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did not expect this error. I would expect `fvm install 2` to install the latest stable Flutter 2 release at the time of running the command. It would expect it to be equivalent to the working command `fvm install 2.10.5@stable`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI had an expectation mismatch because I expected installation behavior similar to the [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Since many folks in the flutter space come from web development, there might be more people who are used to nvm.\r\n\r\nTo compare, if you run `nvm install 14`, it installs `v14.19.3`, which is the latest stable 14.x.x release. The command inferred the latest available patch version of the latest minor version in [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).\r\n\r\nYou can also specify the only the major and minor version, and leave the patch version open, for example, `nvm install 14.10` would install `v14.10.1`, where the `.1` is the last available patch version in that minor version range.\r\n\r\nI would like fvm to also implement this behavior.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nThe alternative is what I did to fix my problem:\r\n1. Googled for the Flutter SDK GitHub project (because fvm seems to directly use git to download versions)\r\n2. Looked at the tags there: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tags\r\n3. Figured out 2.10.5 is the latest stable 2.x.x flutter release at the time of writing.\r\n4. Ran `fvm install 2.10.5`. All good!\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI read [the principles](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/overview#principles).\r\n\r\nI think this change would make the fvm API simpler to use. It reduces my mental load by not requiring me to know or look up what the last Flutter 2 release is.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I recognize that this extra version inference layer would make fvm use git less directly, which might distance it a bit from flutter's usual installation methods. I think it's worth it. \r\n",

I want to use it in Intellij IDEA (Android Studio). My intellij IDEA's project contains a dozen of flutter packages, say `my_app_one`, `my_app_two`, etc. I want `my_app_one` to use flutter beta while `my_app_two` to use flutter stable. If I am using raw fvm everything is OK and I just need to configure using commands. However I want IDE to understand what is happening.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, following the official guide, I can only change the flutter path of the *whole project*, i.e. my_app_one AND my_app_two AND all other packages opened in this IDEA project.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nna\r\n\r\n**Logs**\r\nna\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: [e.g. iOS] ios\r\n- FVM Version [e.g. 22] latest\r\n- If Windows: Which Powershell are you using?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nn/a\r\n",
