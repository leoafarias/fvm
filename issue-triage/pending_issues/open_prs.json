An attacker could craft a malicious commit with a colliding short hash and trick projects into using it.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **GitService**: Added `resolveCommitHash()` using `git rev-parse` to expand commit references to full 40-character SHA-1 hashes\n- **UpdateProjectReferencesWorkflow**: Resolve commit hashes before writing to `.fvmrc` when `version.isUnknownRef` is true\n- **Exports**: Made `GitService` public for testing\n\n## Behavior\n\n```dart\n// User input (short or full hash accepted)\n$ fvm use 6d04a16210\n\n// Stored in .fvmrc (always full hash)\n{\n  \"flutter\": \"6d04a162109d07876230709adf4013db113b16a3\"\n}\n```\n\nOnly commit-based versions are affected.
