There are a few ways to install FVM, and we are working on other ways to make it even simpler.

## Recommendation

We recommend install Flutter SDK globally using the official installation guide [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). This will be the main version of Flutter across your machine.

Use FVM to manage the Flutter SDK version for your projects.

## Standalone

You can download the standalone packages from the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/leoafarias/fvm/releases).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="macos"
  values={[
    { label: "MacOS", value: "macos" },
    { label: "Windows", value: "windows" },
    { label: "Linux", value: "linux" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="macos">

If you use the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh) for Mac OS X, you can install FVM by running

Install

```
brew tap leoafarias/fvm
brew install fvm
```

Uninstall

```
brew uninstall fvm
brew untap leoafarias/fvm
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows">

To install fvm (Install), run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell:

```bash
choco install fvm
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="linux">

If you use the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh) for Linux, you can install FVM by running

Install

```
brew tap leoafarias/fvm
brew install fvm
```

Uninstall

```
brew uninstall fvm
brew untap leoafarias/fvm
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pub package

You are able to also install FVM as a [pub package](https://pub.dev/packages/fvm).

However if you plan on using FVM to manage your [global Flutter install](/docs/guides/global_version) we recommend installing as a standalone.

```bash
dart pub global activate fvm
```
